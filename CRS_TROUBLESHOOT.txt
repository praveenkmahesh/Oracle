Clear temp files:

rm -rf /usr/tmp/.oracle/* /var/tmp/.oracle/* /tmp/.oracle/* ## This command removes socket files. Please run it as root user. 

Restore permissions:

Check the permissions from the following 2 files which are created during Grid Infrastructure installation.

In $GRID_HOME/crs/utl (for 11.2 and 12.1.0.1) and <GRID_HOME>/crs/utl/<hostname> (for 12.1.0.2) directory:

- crsconfig_dirs which has all directories listed in <GRID_HOME> and their permissions

- crsconfig_fileperms which has list of files and their permissions and locations in <GRID_HOME>.


3. The permissions can be reverted back to original values with rootcrs.pl or roothas.pl.  For versions 11.2.0.3.6 and higher, there is an option -init:    

Reset the permissions of all files and directories under Oracle <GRID_HOME>. Please ensure CRS is not running while performing the followings:

For 11.2:
For clustered Grid Infrastructure, as root user

# cd <GRID_HOME>/crs/install/
# ./rootcrs.pl -init
For Standalone Grid Infrastructure, as root user

# cd <GRID_HOME>/crs/install/
# ./roothas.pl  -init

For 12c:
For clustered Grid Infrastructure, as root user

# cd <GRID_HOME>/crs/install/

# ./rootcrs.sh -init
