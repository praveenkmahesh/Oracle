   v$undostat where maxqueryid='&sqlid';

Here are the salient columns of v$undostat and their meanings:

undoblks:  This is the number of undo blocks in the undo tablespace.
maxquerylen:  This column of v$undostat displays the maximum query length (in seconds) of the largest query during the specified time period.  This is used as feedback for setting the undo_retention parameter because undo_retention should be larger than the value returned by the maxquerylen column.  In sum, the undo_retention initialization parameter should be set to a value larger than the maximum query length.
 
expstealcnt:  This v$undostat column shows how many times expired undo blocks were stolen for that time interval.

unxpstealcnt:  This v$undostat column shows how many times unexpired undo blocks were stolen. 
nospaceerrcnt: This v$undostat column shows how many times there was no free space in the undo tablespace. 
ssolderrcnt: This v$undostat column shows how many times queries received the ORA-1555 error message during that time interval. If this column contains non-zero values, consider raising the undo_retention initialization parameter.
Note:  If the expstealcnt, unxpstealcnt or the nospaceerrcnt columns contain non-zero values, your undo tablespace may be sized too small and you should consider increasing the size of your undo tablespace.
